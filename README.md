# Heart-Disease-Prediction

# Problem Statement

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:- Create a model predicting potential Heart Diseases in people using
Machine Learning algorithms.
Task3:-Suggestions to the Hospital to awake the predictions of heart diseases
prevent life threats.

# Domain: Healthcare

# Dataset
1. There are 14 columns in the dataset, where the patient_id column is a unique and
random identifier. The remaining 13 features are described in the section below.
2. · slope_of_peak_exercise_st_segment (type: int): the slope of the peak exercise ST
segment, an electrocardiography read out indicating quality of blood flow to the heart
3. · thal (type: categorical): results of thallium stress test measuring blood flow to
the heart, with possible values normal, fixed_defect, reversible_defect
4. · resting_blood_pressure (type: int): resting blood pressure
5. · chest_pain_type (type: int): chest pain type (4 values)
6. · num_major_vessels (type: int): number of major vessels (0-3) colored by
flourosopy
7. · fasting_blood_sugar_gt_120_mg_per_dl (type: binary): fasting blood sugar &gt; 120
mg/dl
8. · resting_ekg_results (type: int): resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
9. · serum_cholesterol_mg_per_dl (type: int): serum cholestoral in mg/dl
10. · oldpeak_eq_st_depression (type: float): oldpeak = ST depression induced by
exercise relative to rest, a measure of abnormality in electrocardiograms
11. · sex (type: binary): 0: female, 1: male
12. · age (type: int): age in years
13. · max_heart_rate_achieved (type: int): maximum heart rate achieved (beats per
minute)

14. · exercise_induced_angina (type: binary): exercise-induced chest pain (0: False, 1:
True)
